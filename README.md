     <p>While Queens Land amusement park offers decent value for the price paid, there are some areas for improvement. The swimming pool and Niagara Falls attractions are only available for a short period from 1:30 PM to 4:00 PM, which may not provide visitors with sufficient time to fully enjoy these features, leading to potential dissatisfaction. Additionally, the absence of water slide games is a notable drawback, as these are popular attractions in many amusement parks.
